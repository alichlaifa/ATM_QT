# ATM Project
This is a C++ project for an ATM Management System developed using the Qt Framework. The backend functionality (C++ part) is complete, but the project is still a work in progress. The front-end (Qt QML interface) and some additional features are yet to be implemented.

## Key Features (Implemented)
- Database Management: SQLite integration for managing customers, accounts, transactions, and cards.
- Customer Management: Create, retrieve, and delete customers, as well as verify PIN.
- Account Management: Deposit, withdraw, and check account balances.
- Transaction Management: Create, retrieve, and delete transactions.
- ATM Operations: Customer authentication via card and PIN, balance checking, withdrawals.
